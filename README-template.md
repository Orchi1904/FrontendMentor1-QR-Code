### What I learned

This challenge was pretty straightforward and I had so much fun making it ðŸ’»! It was a great first challenge and helped me to review the basics of HTML and CSS. 
The only things I am not really sure about are:

- I had to use a font-size of 17px instead of 15px, as written in the styleguide, because the text would then be on two lines instead of three.
- I was not sure if there is a shadow around the box in the solution. It was hard to tell from the pictures, so I decided not to use a shadow.

I am happy for any feedback!
